    CURRENT DESCRIPTION:
A tree project for inputting an initial word and giving you the most likely word.
This project is designed on top of a trie. The trie currently contains thousands of words, which are then inputted into the tree.

    TIME COMPLEXITY:
With the current version. Looking through the trie causes major issues when trying to use the type ahead mode. The type ahead currently has too broad of a spectrum, so the necessity of time will have to be refactored so the algorithm doesn't grab as many words.
